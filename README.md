# Exploratory and Explanatory Analysis

This repository contains the final project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity. The project focuses on performing both exploratory and explanatory data analysis on a real-world dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore a dataset in depth, understand patterns and relationships in the data, and provide clear insights through visualizations and explanations. The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Exploratory Analysis** – Investigating data distributions, trends, and anomalies.
2. **Explanatory Analysis** – Communicating key insights using visualizations and a narrative.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Ford GoBike Trip Data (February 2019)** dataset:

* File: `201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv`
* Contains bike-sharing trip data including user type, trip duration, start and end stations, and other relevant features.

## Project Files

* `Part_I_exploration.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis.
* `Part_I_exploration.pdf` – PDF version of the exploratory notebook.
* `Part_II_explanatory.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for explanatory analysis and storytelling.
* `Part_II_explanatory.pdf` – PDF version of the explanatory notebook.
* `201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv` – Original dataset.

## Key Steps

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory analysis to identify patterns and anomalies.
3. Explanatory analysis with visualizations and narrative.
4. Presenting insights and actionable conclusions from the dataset.

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darxx03eh/Exploratory-and-Explanatory-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Part_I_exploration.ipynb
   jupyter notebook Part_II_explanatory.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebooks to explore and understand the analyses.
